## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Sty-ven/Steph_Portfolio/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

# Project 1: Employee Attrition
The project is to help a company which is trying to control attrition. The data used for this project is obtained from the Kaggle. Following attributes are available for every employee.

Education
EnvironmentSatisfaction
JobInvolvement
JobSatisfaction
PerformanceRating
RelationshipSatisfaction
WorkLifeBalance
Therefore I am going to answer the following questions:

What is the effect of Income on attrition?
Which set of people are most likey to quit their job?
What is the impact of Age on Employee Attrition?
```

### Jekyll Themes
