# Project 1: Employee Attrition
The project is to help a company which is trying to control attrition. The data used for this project is obtained from the Kaggle. Following attributes are available for every employee.

* Education
* EnvironmentSatisfaction
* JobInvolvement
* JobSatisfaction
* PerformanceRating
* RelationshipSatisfaction
* WorkLifeBalance

Therefore I am going to answer the following questions:

What is the effect of Income on attrition?
Which set of people are most likey to quit their job?
What is the impact of Age on Employee Attrition?
